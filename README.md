# Mind Gro

## Description

Mind Gro is a visual journal app that allows you to reflect on your emotions through journaling. Mind Gro takes what you've journaled, analyzes it and determines what emotional theme that day's journal entry is. Based on the emotion you write, Mind Gro will display a different color flower in the pond.

We built this app to help people get more in touch with how they feel from day to day. We want people to be able to reflect on their emotional state by seeing the week from a birds eye view.

## Usage

To use Mind Gro is very easy, simply click on the lilly pad in the center of the screen to start. Clicking opens up the journaling drawer where you can create a new entry or see previous entries if there are any. Submitting a new entry will send that entry to the tone analyzer which will then produce the corresponding emotional flower color on the lilly pad in the pond.
